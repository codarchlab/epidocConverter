Three joining pieces survive from the right-hand half of a diptych, with probable remains of notches in the right-hand edge. The leaf contains the second column of a letter, which may be missing something at the end (see notes to line 8 and back 2). At the left there are some traces of the ends of lines of the left-hand column which, as often happens, overran the fold; they are so exiguous that we have not attempted to transcribe them. Unusually, the first line of the right-hand column projects at the left. It is noteworthy that the closing greeting is written by the same hand as the rest of the text, but it is possible that a final greeting was added by another hand below this. The name of the addressee on the back clearly begins with <emph>Cassio</emph>, a <emph>gentilicium</emph> which occurs elsewhere in the tablets only in the case of Cassius Saecularis, and the remains of the beginning of the <emph>cognomen</emph> leave us in no doubt that the addressee is Cassius Saecularis (see note to back 1). If the attributions of <ref type="tabletNum">213</ref> and <ref type="tabletNum">214</ref> to Period 2, and of <ref type="tabletNum">215</ref> to Period 3 are correct, it is nevertheless possible that a centurion or decurion or <emph>optio</emph>, or someone holding a &#34;senior staff post&#34; (cf. Breeze (1974)), might have been at Vindolanda and generated correspondence over a number of years (or have been there on more than one posting, separated by some years). The subject-matter of the present letter, the supply of timber, compares well with the evidence in <ref type="tabletNum">213</ref> for Cassius Saecularis' role in supplying barley.
The right-sloping hand is one of some character. <emph>i</emph> with a foot (approaching the shape of <emph>L</emph>) is interesting as is <emph>r,</emph> close to the capital form.

<note id="note1" n="ii 1" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>d<unclear>ice</unclear>s</emph>: we have considered as an alternative <emph>d<unclear>ui</unclear>s</emph>, which cannot be ruled out. In the context, however, a restoration such as <emph>iu]/d<unclear>ice</unclear>s</emph>, or <emph>in]/d<unclear>ice</unclear>s</emph>, from the verb <emph>indico</emph> rather than <emph>index</emph>, would be attractive (cf. <ref type="tabletNum">334</ref>.2). The spacing suggests that <emph>si qui</emph> begins a new sentence.  <br/>After the break at the end of the line, a place-name or location would be appropriate; alternatively we might have had a perfect participle beginning <emph>in-</emph>. If the sense we envisage is on the right lines, <emph>qui</emph> could refer either to people who will have the authority or the objects which someone might obtain &#34;if there are any in (place)&#34;. Since <emph>qui</emph> must be plural here it is impossible to tell whether we have an example of contamination of <emph>quis</emph> and <emph>qui</emph>, see note to line 4. On <emph>si qui</emph> for <emph>si quis</emph> see L&ouml;fstedt (II, 1942), 79-96.
</note>
<note id="note2" n="ii 3" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>Seuerini</emph>: the name, which is reasonably common (e.g. <emph>RIB</emph> I 1212, 1267), does not occur elsewhere in the tablets and the position of the person is unknown. There is a larger than normal space between this and <emph>ego</emph> which is appropriate to a break between sentences.
</note>
<note id="note3" n="ii 4" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>si qui</emph>: in view of <emph>uolet</emph> this must be taken as <emph>si quis</emph>, although it cannot be explained in the same way as <emph>P.Mich</emph>.VIII 468.41 (= <emph>CEL</emph> 142) where there is a following <emph>s</emph>. See Adams (1977), 30, note 112, 47. <br/><emph>uen<unclear>ire</unclear></emph>: this is the least unlikely reading, but <emph>i</emph> is not quite like the other examples and not much survives of <emph>e</emph>; <emph>uen<unclear>iam</unclear></emph> is more difficult.   
</note>
<note id="note4" n="ii 5" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>qu<unclear>o</unclear></emph>: the final letter looks somewhat like <emph>i</emph> but it is unlike other examples in this hand and is harder to construe.<br/><emph>materiem</emph>: cf. <emph>materias</emph>, <ref type="tabletNum">309</ref>.i.3. On the distinction between this and <emph>lignum</emph> see <emph>TLL</emph> VIII 449.64-9, Furneaux on Tacitus, <emph>Ann</emph>. 1.35.1. 
</note>
<note id="note5" n="ii 6" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>aequ&aacute; perfere<unclear>t</unclear></emph>: the final trace does not look easily compatible with either <emph>perfere<unclear>t</unclear></emph> or <emph>perfere<unclear>nt</unclear></emph> but the former makes better sense and assumes less missing at the right where there should be no loss (cf. <ref type="tabletNum">260</ref>, introduction). The obvious reading of the preceding word is <emph>aeque</emph>, but the final <emph>e</emph> would be unlike <emph>e</emph> elsewhere in this text and we do not see how to make sense with it. We think it just possible to read <emph>aequo</emph> with an apex over <emph>o</emph> (cf. back 1), which we suggest is to be understood as for <emph>aequo animo</emph> (cf. <ref type="tabletNum">302</ref>.5, <emph>aequo emantur</emph>, i.e. <emph>aequo pretio</emph>).
</note>
<note id="note6" n="ii 8" type="line" anchored="yes">
 It is possible that a second hand has added (e.g.) <emph>uale frater</emph> below this, cf. <ref type="tabletNum">250</ref>.ii.17. 
</note>
<note id="note7" n="Back 1" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>Cassi&oacute;</emph>: the apex is clear. It is curious that the <emph>cognomen</emph> is so badly abraded when the <emph>gentilicium</emph> just before it is very clear. The long diagonal ascender in the first letter can hardly be anything but <emph>s</emph> and the second could well be <emph>a</emph>.
</note>
<note id="note8" n="Back 2" type="line" anchored="yes">
 <emph>]<unclear>e</unclear> <unclear>cor</unclear>niclario</emph>: this is written with a pronounced slant from bottom left to top right which is quite normal in this position. The first four surviving letters are abraded and obscured by dirt but the reading is not in any real doubt. <emph>cornic(u)larius</emph> unlike <emph>cornicen</emph> (see <ref type="tabletNum">182</ref>.i.1 note) is not attested as a name (Cornicula, <emph>LC</emph> 331, is not related to the military title) and it must therefore indicate the writer's position. For legionary and auxiliary <emph>cornicularii</emph>, characterised as &#34;senior staff officers&#34;, see Breeze (1974), 267-76, 280-86; in the legions this was a position from which men were regularly promoted to the centurionate. An auxiliary <emph>cornicularius</emph> appears in <emph>CEL</emph> 140.27 (= <emph>P.Oxy</emph>. VII 1022, AD 103). There is no way of knowing whether we are here dealing with a legionary or an auxiliary <emph>cornicularius</emph>. The title will have been preceded by a name, for which <emph><unclear>e</unclear></emph> is a suitable termination. This must mean that something has been lost from the bottom of the leaf, cf. note to line 8.
